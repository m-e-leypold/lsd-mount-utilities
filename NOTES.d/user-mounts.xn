    How mounting by users works
    ___________________________
    
    
    Option 'user' in fstab required. This already guards the call to
    mount.$FSTYPE. Mounting then must enter user=$USER into the
    options for mtab.
    
    Unmounting checks again for the user option and then compares
    user=... with the name of the user corresponding to the uid (not
    the euid). If they agree, the umount.$FSTYPE utility is called.
