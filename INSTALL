*   What will be installed?
    =======================

    - /sbin/loclean        - a tool to delete the file associations of unused loopback devices.
    - /sbin/mount.lcrypt   - mount helper to mount encrypted file systems
    - /sbin/umount.lcrypt  - unmount helper to unmount encrypted file systems


*   How to compile/install
    ======================

**  Requirements
    ------------

    You need GNU make and ocaml (3.8 or later, has been tested with
    3.8). Since the LSD mount utilities a targetted towards Linux,
    this should not be a problem with a relatively recently
    distribution.


**  Configuration
    -------------

    It should not be necessary to do extra configuration. If it
    actually is necessary, you can edit the first section of the
    'Makefile' to set compilation and installation parameters (like owner and mode).


**  Compilation
    -----------

    Type

      $ make all

    This should create utilities listed above under "What will be installed?".


**  Installation
    ------------

    In principle the installation is done by typing

      $ make install

    The default target directory and installation file modes depend on
    wether you're doing this as root or as normal (unprivilged) user.

      - As root -> installs to /sbin and set uid bits (mode 4755) for mount.lcrypt and umount

      - As normal user -> installs to FILES/sbin (subdirectory of
        source directory), doesn't set suid bits or ownership).

    If you want to do package for Debian you'll probably have to use fakeroot. You can use

      - INSTALL-ARGS-USER, INSTALL-ARGS-ROOT to override modes and owenership set during installation.
      - DEST to override target directory for installation (to $(DEST)/sbin).


*   Using the utilities 
    ===================

**  Generally
    ---------

    In Linux /sbin/mount calls /sbin/mount.$FSTYPE and /sbin/umount
    calls /sbin/umount.$FSTYPE if those programs exist. This leads to
    the observation, that the filesystem types either in /etc/fstab or
    passed to mount with -t rather more characterize rather a mounting
    mechanism than a file system type. 

    With the LSD mount utilities this mechanism is used to delegate
    mounting of encrypted loopback devices to mount.lcrypt which
    automates the steps necessary to set up those devices (like:
    modprobe, losetup, cryptsetup). 

    mount.lcrypt on the other side should know the filesystem of the
    decrypted device from a mount option. (This does not work yet,
    presently all lcrypt devices have the decrypted filesystem type
    ext2).


**  Mounting directly
    -----------------

    Pass '-t lcrypt' to mount:

      mount -t lcrypt /data/encrypted-image /mnt 

    You'll be asked for the passphrase.
    

**  With fstab / allow user mounting
    --------------------------------

    Use lcrypt as filesystemtype. Use the option 'user', if non
    privileged users should be able to mount the device:

      /data/encrypted-image /secret-mnt lcrypt  rw,noauto,user,exec 0 0
