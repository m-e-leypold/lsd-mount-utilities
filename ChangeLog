-----------------

	* Fixed some bugs: (1) Exception during loop probing when loop is
	  compiled into kernel. (2) Mount was entered into mtab as type
	  dmcrpyt2 instead of lcrypt. (3) Error in not reraising
	  exceptions during some failures (and thus not freeing resources).
	
	* Restructured mountlib.ml somewhat with an eye on future
	  re-usability in other projects. This effort is incomplete and
	  will be continued.

	=> Release 1.2, M E Leypold <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* mountlib.ml:

	  Gar nicht. Man macht einfach weiter, dann scheitert der mount halt,
	  wenn's das nicht war. Ich hab das gleich mal eingebaut.

	* mountlib.ml: Renamed functions and grouped them in sub modules
	  (this has been done with an eye on later reuse in other
	  projects). Only partially done so far!
	  
	  Move cryptsetup functions into module Crypto_device. Luks_device
	  should do the same for Luks. 
	  	  

	* mount.lcrypt.ml: Fixed typo (fstype was entered as dmcrypt2
	  instead of lcrypt -> this perhaps is responsible that we couldn't
	  reproduce the trailing '/' problem reported by AU.

	  Actually I cannot understand how that could have worked before.

	  REQUIRES EXTRA TESTING NOW!
	  
	* Various files: Changes to reflect renaming in mountlib.ml.

2007-01-30  M E Leypold  <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* README: Corrected typo, mangled e-mail address.
	
	* mount.lcrypt.ml: Added missing reraising or exceptions on failure of final mount procedure.
