Changes 1.2.1 - 1.3
-------------------

	* LUKS support has been tested (by Alexander Ulrich) and does not seem to fail.

	* Added basic vesions of mkfs and fsck.
	

2007-02-14  M E Leypold  <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* subprocess.ml: Added debugging instrumentation (controlled with
	  lsd_debug_subprocess=verbose).
	
	* fsck.lcrypt.ml: Basic option processing has been added (actually
	  only the container file name is read from the command line,
	  fsck.lcrypt bails out if any othe options are passed.

	* mkfs.lcrypt.m, mountlib.ml: Added argument processing to
	  mkfs. Any flags passed to/by the wrapper are presently
	  dropped. Ther is no way to have other filesystems but ext2 at
	  the moment.


2007-02-04  M E Leypold  <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* mkfs.lcrypt.ml, fsck.lcrypt.ml: Basic scaffolding for mkfs and
	  fsck functionality. Still need to implement proper command line
	  argument processing and passing arguments through to the sub
	  processes.
	

Changes 1.2 - 1.2.1
-------------------

	* Continued to restructure mountlib.ml. I think that's it basically (minor changes might still
	  occur).

	* Integrated preliminary LUKS support.

	* Version numbering has been changed: x.y.z: y => major change in
	  functionality, y => incremental changes, z => patches and
	  development releases.

2007-02-04  M E Leypold  <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* subprocess.ml: Some debugging code (print subprocess run). This
	  will be removed again in 1.3 and later.

2007-02-04  M E Leypold  <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* mount.lcrypt.ml, mountlib.ml, mountlib.mli, umount.lcrypt.ml:
	  Gratitious renaming and reorganization in hierarchilly organized
	  modules for (hopefully) easier reuse later on.	
	  
	* umount.lcrypt.ml, mount.lcrypt.ml: Preliminary Integration of
  	  support for LUKS. UNTESTED.

	  Errors during probing etc. still go to stdout. This will have to
	  change.
	

2007-02-03  M E Leypold  <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* mountlib.mli: Added LUKS support (to lib only).

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	

Changes 1.1 - 1.2
-----------------

	* Fixed some bugs: (1) Exception during loop probing when loop is
	  compiled into kernel. (2) Mount was entered into mtab as type
	  dmcrpyt2 instead of lcrypt. (3) Error in not reraising
	  exceptions during some failures (and thus not freeing resources).
	
	* Restructured mountlib.ml somewhat with an eye on future
	  re-usability in other projects. This effort is incomplete and
	  will be continued.

	=> Release 1.2, M E Leypold <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* mountlib.ml:

	  > Ich weiss gerade

	  Gar nicht. Man macht einfach weiter, dann scheitert der mount halt,
	  wenn's das nicht war. Ich hab das gleich mal eingebaut.


2007-02-01  M E Leypold  <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* mountlib.ml: Renamed functions and grouped them in sub modules
	  (this has been done with an eye on later reuse in other
	  projects). Only partially done so far!
	  
	  Move cryptsetup functions into module Crypto_device. Luks_device
	  should do the same for Luks. 
	  	  

	* mount.lcrypt.ml: Fixed typo (fstype was entered as dmcrypt2
	  instead of lcrypt -> this perhaps is responsible that we couldn't
	  reproduce the trailing '/' problem reported by AU.

	  Actually I cannot understand how that could have worked before.

	  REQUIRES EXTRA TESTING NOW!
	  
	* Various files: Changes to reflect renaming in mountlib.ml.

2007-01-30  M E Leypold  <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8aREMOVETHIS@ANDTHATm-e-leypold.de>

	* README: Corrected typo, mangled e-mail address.
	
	* mount.lcrypt.ml: Added missing reraising or exceptions on failure of final mount procedure.
