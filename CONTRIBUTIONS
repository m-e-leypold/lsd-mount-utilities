*   The rules
    =========
    
    If you send patches to us, we want you to transfer the rights to
    your contribution to us (M E Leypold <development-2006-8ecbb5cc8a
    REMOVETHIS AT ANDTHAT m-e-leypold.de>). We need that, since we
    want to keep open the option to relicense the code with linking
    exceptions, under a BSD license or even for closed software, and
    do not want to get a flock of contributors to agree to anything in
    some months or years.
    
    (This is basically what the FSF does, when they require to
     transfer the rights to source contributed to GNU projects to
     them).
    
    We will ask you for some statement to that effect when you send
    code or patches to us.
        
    If you cannot live with that terms, please feel free to discussion
    your problems with us. We are not evil :-) and open to change.
